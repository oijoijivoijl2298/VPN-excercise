we were searching for different instructions on the web and used this one because of the simplicity.
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-centos-7
at the end we did not succeed in setting up the server.
some of the problems we encountered were:
1. In the sandbox environment the instance good not be reached by its public ip. 
2. We had to create and use own keys.
3. We only could connect using its dns name.
4. We did install the firewalld while this was unnessary. The server / instance is protected by the securitygroup in our VPC.
5. We did not sufficently tag our instances so one team member was trying to terminate them while another member was busy launcing it.
6. We did finally use the sandbox environement of the canvas instead of the Techgrounds.edu. aws.
Finally we understand the concept of setting up the vpn server and tunneling the trafic between remote machines.
As a final thought we concluded AWS own vpn service is prefered because that is managed.
